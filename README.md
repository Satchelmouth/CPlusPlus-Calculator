# Calculator
I built this calculator as a development project to help me learn c++. 
Feel free to use the code as you wish but be aware that this is based on an IMGUI integration called [Walnut](https://github.com/TheCherno/Walnut). 
See below for more information on setup and dependancies.

I have no idea why anyone would, but if you got some use out of my code, and fancy buying me a coffee, more caffiene is always welcome >.< https://www.buymeacoffee.com/Satchelmouth

# Walnut
Walnut is a simple application framework built with Dear ImGui and designed to be used with Vulkan - basically this means you can seemlessly blend real-time Vulkan rendering with a great UI library to build desktop applications. The plan is to expand Walnut to include common utilities to make immediate-mode desktop apps and simple Vulkan applications.

Currently supports Windows - with macOS and Linux support planned. Setup scripts support Visual Studio 2022 by default.

## Requirements
- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.com) (not strictly required, however included setup scripts only support this)
- [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#windows) (preferably a recent version)

## Getting Started
Once you've cloned, run `scripts/Setup.bat` to generate Visual Studio 2022 solution/project files. Once you've opened the solution, you can run the WalnutApp project to see a basic example (code in `WalnutApp.cpp`). I recommend modifying that WalnutApp project to create your own application, as everything should be setup and ready to go.
